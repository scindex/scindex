# G0210-01: Firmware Code Formatting Standard

## Standard
All C++ firmware code submitted to the project repository must be formatted using the `clang-format` tool with the `Google` style guide as its basis. A `.clang-format` configuration file will be maintained in the root of the firmware source directory.
