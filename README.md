# Software Component Index (‚Äúscindex‚Äù)

The Software Component Index ("SCIndex", pronounced **IPA: /Ààs…™ndeks/** or SIN-deks) is a vendor-neutral, open-standard specification for categorizing and numbering all components of a software system.

To address the software industry's lack of a standard identifier system the Scindex provides a universal indexing system for documenting software projects. Scindex codes are human and machine readable, comparable across products, scalable, robustly traceable, and fit for operationalized uses such as linting, auto-lookup, and AI context setting. Inspired by the AEC industry's "[MasterFormat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterFormat)," Scindex creates a common language that brings immediate clarity to the scope and context of records, enabling improved analysis and interoperability across teams and tools.

## Quick Start (LLM prompt)

To obtain a list of Scindex codes relevant to your project follow these steps:
- Download or copy the latest [scindex.txt](https://github.com/scindex/scindex/releases/download/v0.2.3/scindex.txt) release
- Open your favorite LLM prompt tool and create a prompt similar to the following:

```
You are a senior software architect tasked with analyzing a new project proposal using the Software Component Index (Scindex), a standard for classifying software components. 

**Project Description:** 
A web application, hosted on Microsoft Azure, that allows authenticated users to adjust their home lighting system and temperature controls. The system integrates with Google Home. Users can create profiles and preferences, and set time- and temperature-based rules for automation. The backend will be deployed as containers, and the system must be highly reliable. 

**Your Task:** 
Based on the full Scindex provided below in text format, identify all relevant item codes for which product requirements should be drafted. Present your answer grouped by the Scindex Division. For each code, provide a brief justification for its relevance to the project.

```

- Follow the usage instructions below to build full robustly traceable Scindex-based ids for all documents and artifacts in your project.
## Usage

Scindex provides a structured core identifier that can be flexibly prefixed and suffixed to meet various documentation needs.

The full pattern is: `[PREFIX]-[Scindex Code]-[SUFFIX]`

See the examples directory for sample document sets that make use of scindex-based IDs.

### **Core Concept: The Scindex Code**

The **Scindex Code** is the basis of the system, pinpointing a specific category within the software architecture by concatenating three parts:

* **Division (`D`):** An alphabetic character code representing a major architectural area.
* **Section (`01`):** A two-digit code for a section within the division.
* **Item (`40`):** A two-digit code for a specific component type within the section.

For example, the Scindex Code for "Graph Databases" is `D0140`.

---

### **Building a Full Identifier**

You create a complete, unique ID by adding a prefix and a suffix to the Scindex Code.

* **Prefix (Optional):** Identifies the *type* of record. This allows you to manage requirements, decisions, and tests all within the same numbering system.
    * `REQ`: Requirement
    * `ADR`: Architecture Decision Record
    * `TEST`: Test Case
* **Suffix (Required):** A unique ID for the specific record within that category.

#### **Example 1: Architecture Decision**

An ID of **`ADR-D0140-32`** is broken down as:

* `ADR`: This is an Architecture Decision Record.
* `D0140`: The decision relates to "Graph Databases  (`D` -> Data Management, `01` -> Databases, `40` -> Graph Databases)"
* `32`: It's the 32nd decision logged for this category.

#### **Example 2: Requirement**

An ID of `REQ-S0210-5` is broken down as:

* `REQ`: This is a Requirement.
* `S0210`: The requirement relates to "Logging" (`S` -> System Services, `02` -> Observability, `10` -> Logging).
* `5`: It's the 5th requirement defined for the logging category.

---

### **Flexibility in Practice**

The system is designed to be adaptable.

* **Omitting the Prefix:** If your document collection *only* contains requirements, you can omit the `REQ-` prefix for brevity (e.g., `D0140-32`).
* **Flexible Suffixes:** While simple integers are recommended, the suffix can be any format that suits your project's needs, such as `-1a`, `-v2`, `-3.2` or `-20250716`.

This flexibility makes searching and filtering straightforward. For instance, `grep "ADR-D"` would find all architectural decisions related to the data division in documents and source code comments and tags.

## Key Features

* **Human-Readable:** The codes are designed to be quickly understood by people. The use of alphabetic **Division codes** (e.g., `D`, `S`) provides immediate context without implying a rigid order, while the numeric components are easy to scan.

* **Sayable:** The structure is meant to be spoken easily in conversations. For example, the code `D0140` is simply said as "data one-forty," or "D one-forty" which simplifies communication between team members.

* **Predictable Structure:** The standard `[DIVISION][SECTION][ITEM]` format (e.g., `D0140`) has a consistent length, which makes it reliable for automated parsing, pattern-based validation, and use in other tooling.

* **Hierarchical, Scalable & Stable:** The system is inherently hierarchical, reflecting how software components are often organized. New divisions, sections, and items can be added without needing to re-number existing codes.

* **Logical Grouping:** Using a standard count for **Sections** and a "10-series" for **Item codes** (e.g., `10`, `20`, `30`) creates clear, high-level groupings within a section and makes section ids discernibly different from item ids. This provides a logical structure while still allowing for numbers in between (e.g., `11`, `12`) if more granular items need to be added later.

## Special Conventions

To enhance the organization of documentation, the Scindex includes two special numeric conventions: `00` for summaries and `99` for provisional items.

### The '00' Summary Code
The `00` code is reserved for creating high-level summary documents that describe the architectural approach or guiding principles for an entire division or section.

* **Division Summary (e.g., `D0000`)**: A document with this code provides an overall summary for its entire division. For example, `D0000` would be the place for a document describing the complete data management strategy.
* **Section Summary (e.g., `D0100`)**: A document with this code provides a summary for a specific section. For example, `D0100` would describe the project's overall approach to databases.

### The '99' Provisional Code
The `99` code acts as a standardized "escape hatch" for components that do not yet have a formal category in the Scindex. Its use should be temporary and is meant to encourage the evolution of the standard.

* **Provisional Section (e.g., `P9999`)**: If a component belongs to a division (like Platform) but none of the existing sections fit, it can be placed in the provisional section.
* **Provisional Item (e.g., `P0199`)**: If a component fits within an existing section (like Compute) but none of the items are appropriate, it can use the provisional item code.

**Important**: Usage of a `99` code should always be followed by submitting a "Suggestion" issue to the Scindex project to have a new, formal category created.

### Quick Reference

| Code | Purpose | Use When... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`00`** | **Summary** | You are writing a high-level overview or architectural vision for a division or section. |
| **`99`** | **Provisional** | A component doesn't fit any existing category and you need a temporary placeholder. |

## Releases & Downloads

The Scindex project uses semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`). Official versions are managed through tagged **GitHub Releases**.

Each release includes the complete index in several convenient formats:
* **YAML** (`scindex.yaml`)
* **JSON** (`scindex.json`)
* **TOML** (`scindex.toml`)

To get the latest version, please visit the official **[Releases Page](https://github.com/scindex/scindex/releases)**, where you can download the files for the version you need.
